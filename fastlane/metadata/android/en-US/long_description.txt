Cwtch (/kʊtʃ/ - a Welsh word roughly translating to “a hug that creates a safe place”) is a decentralized,
 privacy-preserving, multi-party messaging protocol that can be used to build metadata resistant applications.

- Decentralized and Open: There is no “Cwtch service” or “Cwtch network”. Participants in Cwtch
can host their own safe spaces, or lend their infrastructure to others seeking a safe space.
The Cwtch protocol is open, and anyone is free to build bots, services and user interfaces and
integrate and interact with Cwtch.

- Privacy Preserving: All communication in Cwtch is end-to-end encrypted and takes place over Tor v3
onion services.

 - Metadata Resistant: Cwtch has been designed such that no information is exchanged or available to
anyone without their explicit consent, including on-the-wire messages and protocol metadata.
